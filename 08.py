# This code snippet is creating a list called `array` with elements 10, 20, and 30. It then calculates
# the sum of all elements in the `array` using the `sum()` function and assigns it to the variable
# `sum`. Finally, it prints out the sum of the array using the `print()` function.
array = [10,20,30]
sum= sum(array)

print("Sum of array is : " , sum)
